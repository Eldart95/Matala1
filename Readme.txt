OVERVIEW:
----------------------
This package is an elaboration of the previous Package.
This package handls Complex Functions.
An complex function is a function, that hold a sign , a left fucntion and a right function
The left and right function can be complex functions themselves or polynoms.
The sign can be one of:
Plus.
Divid.
Times.
Comp.
Min.
Max.
None.
----------------------



CONTENT:
----------------------
-Interfaces: Polynom_able, cont_function,function,functions.
-Test classes: PolynomJTest, MonomJTest, ComplexFunctionJTest, Functions_GUIJTest.
-Classes: Monom,Polynom,Monom_comperator,ComplexFunction,Functions_GUI.

----------------------

MUST-KNOW:
----------------------
-Equals works in a super limited way.
-The ComplexFunction should look like : g(f1,f2) 
-g is the Sign.
-f1 is the left child.
-f2 is the right child.
----------------------

EXEPTIONS:
----------------------
-Same exeptions from previous package.
-Exeptions in reading and writing from and to files.
----------------------




CLASSES:
----------------------
ComplexFunction: represnts a ComplexFunction made of polynoms or complex functions and a sign.
